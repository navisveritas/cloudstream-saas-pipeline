# CloudStream SaaS: Full-Stack Data Pipeline
**Developed by: Navis Zuhud**

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full-cycle Data Engineering and BI workflow. I built a relational MySQL database from scratch to simulate a SaaS environment, then engineered a live-connected Tableau dashboard to provide executive-level insights into revenue, churn, and regional performance.

## Key Features & Insights
- SQL Engine: Designed a 4-table normalized schema to track 100+ transactional records across 12 US states.
- Executive KPIs: Real-time tracking of $2,008.99 total revenue and 92.08% user retention.
- Regional Analysis: Identified Texas ($269.91) as the highest revenue-generating market.
- Interactive UX: Built "Action Filters" allowing stakeholders to segment the entire dashboard by clicking on specific subscription tiers.

## Tech Stack
- Database: MySQL
- Visualization: Tableau Desktop (.twbx)
- Engineering: Data Modeling, Schema Design, SQL Joins
